## Project Title

Exploring Apartment Building Maintenance and Management Trends

## Overview

This project aims to analyze apartment building maintenance and management trends using data from RentSafeTO, a program designed to ensure compliance with building maintenance standards in Toronto. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and linear regression modeling, the project seeks to identify factors influencing building scores, such as building age and graffiti severity, and quantify their impact on overall building quality.


## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from OpenDataToronto.
-   `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `model` contains fitted models. 
-   `other` contains relevant  details about LLM chat interactions.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.
